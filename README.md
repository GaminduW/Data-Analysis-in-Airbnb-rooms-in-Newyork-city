# Data-Analysis-in-Airbnb-rooms-in-Newyork-city

New York City has a variety of Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, with several different price levels, room types, and locations.
    What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews? 
    How many of the listings are private rooms? 
    What is the average listing price?  (two decimal places)
    Combine the new variables into one DataFrame called review_dates with four columns in the following order: first_reviewed, last_reviewed, nb_private_rooms, and avg_price. The DataFrame should only contain one row of values.
